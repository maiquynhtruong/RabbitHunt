# Rabbit Hunt
The game models a fox hunting a rabbit.

The game components include the fox, rabbit and bushes. The fox and rabbit can only see in 6 directions: 
Two horizontals, two verticals and 4 diagonals.
Neither the fox or rabbit can see through the bushes. Therefore, the rabbit tries to hide behind the bushes.
The two animals take turn moving. THey both advance one cell in on of four directions each time.
Once the rabbit sees the fox, it can either change direction get out of the fox's sight, or keep moving towards a bush.
If the fox loses sight of the rabbit, it can either keep moving forward in case the rabbit just get out of the fox's signt, 
or change direction to try out its luck in searching for the rabbit.

The game gets more thrilling as the fox comes closer to the rabbit.
